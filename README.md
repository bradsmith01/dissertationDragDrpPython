# dissertationDragDrpPython
This is my Dissertation project for my Masters of Science Computer Science. The project is a web based IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for beginners and younger programmers trying to understand Python.   

The projects main goal is to allow users to Drag and Drop programming similar to how Scratch by MIT works. However, the outcome of the Drag and Drop is not a sprite but instead python code.   
  
Frameworks Used:
Ace Editor by Ajax - code Editor,  
Blockly by Google - Blocks for Drag and Drop,  
Bootstrap 5 - General Layout and styling.  
  
The website has no accounts it is a simple plug and play website. It's name is 'PyGoEasy' as the aim is to help teach young people and beginners how to program in an easy way. The website is available at:
